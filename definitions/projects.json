			"desc": "For 2018 I decided to set a personal goal of making a game-jam-like game every month on my own time. I have already had to ammend that slightly to accomodate for some life events I have in February, but I do intend to keep with the spirit of the goal for the rest of the year. January's submission is inspired by both my interest in procedural generation and the fun I had with an air hockey table my parents got me when I was little. The collisions are still a bit dicey (my first time doing continuous physics), but hopefully you get the idea. This one was entirely HTML5 and no libraries, which means I got to re-learn all of my linear algebra in order to do my own collisions.",
