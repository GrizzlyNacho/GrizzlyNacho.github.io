	<h1>Nathaniel Lutz</h1>
	<p>
		I'm a game developer and programmer in Canada. I work professionally at a studio in Ontario, and I dabble in my spare time on a bunch of interests. I have a background in Computer Science and Mathematics and a passion for games.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've always had an itch to make things, so you'll find more than just code on here as I finish and publish things. I've worked in 3D printing, costume making, and carpentry, but I'll use any medium to bring something to life.
